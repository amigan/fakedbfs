$Amigan: fakedbfs/TODO,v 1.37 2006/04/19 19:06:54 dcp1990 Exp $

TODO as of 2.0-RELEASE (double stars means "must do before release of 2.0-RELEASE", usually for reasons
of not having to deal with large-scale API and DB format changes [this is a major version, after all]):
*Mucho memory leaks. Some kind soul should run valgrind and fix them. I don't have the time; I will when
	I port to amiga. (dmalloc helps greatly)
**Fix prototypes of functions to use const qualifier if they copy string args
*portable findex indexer (in addition to FTS)
*Write more plugins
*Write more specfiles
*Document every API function
*grep -R -E 'XXX:|TODO:' * and fix
*Win32 port
*Win32 applications
*Amiga port
*Add installation features to the build process (Makefile, etc)
*Fix build system such that we link against the freshly-built library and not one in /usr/local/lib if it's there
*Improve handling of SQLITE_BUSY and other concurrent access stuff
*Finish ficl bindings! Do we create a new ficlSystem or just a ficlVm per plugin? Save memory!
*Test new separation of catalogues and definitions more thoroughly.
*Improve atomicity of various operations; make use of SQLite transactions (this will require some state information
 to be present in the fdbfs_t)
*Remove dependency on lex and write own tokeniser for dbspecs. This will make us almost 100% thread safe.

Wishlist for 1.2/2.0:
*Build in Unix-specific stuff for platforms that don't have it (such as FTS)
*Implement some VFS stuff (FUSE, the new thing for SoC, Tcl VFS)
*Use Ficl as an interpreter for FORTH-based plugins (and add a fakedbfs dictionary)
