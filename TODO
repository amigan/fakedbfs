$Amigan: fakedbfs/TODO,v 1.32 2006/02/24 17:56:19 dcp1990 Exp $

TODO as of 2.0-RELEASE (double stars means "must do before release of 2.0-RELEASE", usually for reasons
of not having to deal with large-scale API and DB format changes [this is a major version, after all]):
*Mucho memory leaks. Some kind soul should run valgrind and fix them. I don't have the time; I will when
	I port to amiga. (dmalloc helps greatly)
*portable findex indexer (in addition to FTS)
**Finish (or at least make usable) fedit utility
**Bring music.c's add_int_field and add_str_field (and add other) functions into the libfakedbfs proper, make a neat
  API for them, and change all code that adds simple fields to use them )half done, still have to convert existing code)
**Add a genericised interface for setting MIME types (instead of our current "just add a field called mime" way)
*Write more plugins
*Write more specfiles
*Document every API function
*grep -R -E 'XXX:|TODO:' * and fix
*Win32 port
*Win32 applications
*Amiga port
*Add installation features to the build process (Makefile, etc)
*Fix build system such that we link against the freshly-built library and not one in /usr/local/lib if it's there
*Improve handling of SQLITE_BUSY and other concurrent access stuff
*Finish ficl bindings! Do we create a new ficlSystem or just a ficlVm per plugin? Save memory!
**Separate the notions of catalogue definitions and actual catalogues, so you can have more than one instance
  of a certain catalogue type. For example, you can have more than one music catalogue in the same database.

Wishlist for 1.2/2.0:
*Build in Unix-specific stuff for platforms that don't have it (such as FTS)
*Implement some VFS stuff (FUSE, the new thing for SoC, Tcl VFS)
*Use Ficl as an interpreter for FORTH-based plugins (and add a fakedbfs dictionary)
