TODO as of 1.0-RELEASE (double stars means "must do before release of 1.1-RELEASE"):
*Mucho memory leaks. Some kind soul should run valgrind and fix them. I don't have the time; I will when
	I port to amiga. (dmalloc helps greatly)
*Add support for ogg to the music plugin
*Write more plugins
*Write more specfiles
**Make music plugin use freg
*Document every API function
*grep -R -E 'XXX:|TODO:' * and fix
**Win32 port
*Win32 applications
*Amiga port
**Add installation features to the build process (Makefile, etc)

Wishlist for 1.2/2.0:
*Build in Unix-specific stuff for platforms that don't have it (such as FTS)
