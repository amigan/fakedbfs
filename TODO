TODO as of 2.0-RELEASE (double stars means "must do before release of 2.0-RELEASE"):
*Mucho memory leaks. Some kind soul should run valgrind and fix them. I don't have the time; I will when
	I port to amiga. (dmalloc helps greatly)
*portable findex indexer (in addition to FTS)
*Finish fedit utility
*Add support for ogg to the music plugin
*Write more plugins
*Write more specfiles
*Document every API function
*grep -R -E 'XXX:|TODO:' * and fix
*Win32 port
*Win32 applications
*Amiga port
*Add installation features to the build process (Makefile, etc)
*Fix build system such that we link against the freshly-built library and not one in /usr/local/lib if it's there
*Improve handling of SQLITE_BUSY and other concurrent access stuff

Wishlist for 1.2/2.0:
*Build in Unix-specific stuff for platforms that don't have it (such as FTS)
*Implement some VFS stuff (FUSE, the new thing for SoC, Tcl VFS)
*Use Ficl as an interpreter for FORTH-based plugins (and add a fakedbfs dictionary)
