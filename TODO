TODO as of 1.0 (double stars means "must do before release"):
**Fix problem with this query: QUERY CAT music WHERE title =~ /\/
**Handle backslash escapes in qtokeniser
*Mucho memory leaks. Some kind soul should run valgrind and fix them. I don't have the time; I will when
	I port to amiga. (dmalloc helps greatly)
*Add support for ogg to the music plugin
*Write more plugins
*Write more specfiles
*Document every API function
**grep -R -E 'XXX:|TODO:' * and fix
**Win32 port
*Win32 applications
*Amiga port
**Add installation features to the build process (Makefile, etc)

Wishlist for 1.2/2.0:
*Build in Unix-specific stuff for platforms that don't have it
