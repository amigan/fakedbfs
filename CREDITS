Special thanks to Caelian and pillBOX for their help with debugging my memory issues.

ficl (http://ficl.sourceforge.net/) is (C)1997-2001, John Sadler.

Also thanks to the SQLite developers, creators of what is quite possibly the best damned database
library on the planet. And thanks of course to the people who bring you vim. And to the FreeBSD project,
who made this whole thing possible (must I remind you what my development machines run?).

Ok, this is starting to sound like an academy award. I'll stop.
