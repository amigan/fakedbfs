*THE GREAT RENAMING....most symbols start with fdbfs_ now, and stuff has been split up. Major changes.
*doxygen API docs...finally!
*Thanks to fez (new amd64 workstation), this code should now be mostly 64bit clean. I also made some changes to ficl to make it 64bit clean.
 I submitted those patches to the ficl team. Hopefully they will be integrated.
*ficl has been imported into the tree and work started; see libfakedbfs/ficl.c
*answer_t members have been consolidated into a union to save space. This may cause problems; we'll see
*freg now supports substrings; the API has changed to support this. See the freg_* functions.
*configuration subsystem added
*mime field now mandatory in database; this is possibly incompatible.

1.1.0-RELEASE ("Bodhisattva")
*All indexing functions now accept a last argument, def, for default fields. This is to facilitate our default spec parser for findex(1).

*Introduced time datatype for lastupdate, along with support for it in fquery(1)
*Added -u option to findex(1) for defspecs
*New defspec code
*Fixed various querying bugs (choking on the oth_ stuff when an enum didn't have an oth_ field, for example)

*Added !=,>,<,>=,<= operators and associated opcodes to query subsystem
*fedit "works"

1.0.0-RELEASE ("Steely Dan")
