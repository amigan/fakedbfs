Changelog

*ficl has been imported into the tree and work started; see libfakedbfs/ficl.c

*freg now supports substrings; the API has changed to support this. See the freg_* functions.
*configuration subsystem added
*mime field now mandatory in database; this is possibly incompatible.

*Introduced time datatype for lastupdate, along with support for it in fquery(1)
*Added -u option to findex(1) for defspecs
*New defspec code
*Fixed various querying bugs (choking on the oth_ stuff when an enum didn't have an oth_ field, for example)
*Queries now support COLS()
*Added !=,>,<,>=,<= operators and associated opcodes to query subsystem
*fedit "works"

1.0.0-RELEASE ("Steely Dan")
