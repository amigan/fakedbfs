Changelog

1.1.0-RELEASE ("Bodhisattva")
*All indexing functions now accept a last argument, def, for default fields. This is to facilitate our default spec parser for findex(1).
*Makefiles should work with gmake
*Introduced new usnumber element into DataType enum. This shouldn't require the database to be redone, since it's the last element.
*Introduced time datatype for lastupdate, along with support for it in fquery(1)
*Added -u option to findex(1) for defspecs
*New defspec code

1.0.0-RELEASE ("Steely Dan")
