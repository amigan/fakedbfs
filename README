$Amigan: fakedbfs/README,v 1.6 2005/10/07 20:57:35 dcp1990 Exp $

This is the fakedbfs distribution, version 1.1.0-RELEASE (Bodhisattva). See the contents of
doc/ for more information. I know API docs suck now...I plan on changing this with 1.1-RELEASE.
Feel free to email me at <dcp1990@neptune.atopia.net> if you have any questions.


REQUIRES:
-A Unix system (win32 and amiga currently not supported...this is a priority for 1.1-RELEASE!)
-sqlite-3.2.7 or later installed
-id3lib if you want to build plugins/music/

This was primarily developed on FreeBSD. While I have made it a point to try to make stuff portable,
it may have problems building on systems such as Linux or Solaris. Please, mail me if you have such problems!

TO BUILD:

vim fdbfsconfig
make
sh config.sh tclsh8.4
(replace tclsh8.4 with the name of tclsh on your system)

Currently, there are no installation procedures. I will have these next release.

Make targets include all, clean, configclean (removes only config files), and allclean (clean and configclean)


fdbfsconfig options:

platform <unix|amiga|win32>
	selects target/build platform. This MUST be present.

prefix path
	sets prefix to whatever (default .)

dmalloc
	if you want to build with dmalloc, set this

freedebug
	for free() debugging....useful for debugging memory leaks within the dbinit subsystem

pcre pcre-config_path
	Use libpcre instead of POSIX regexs. pcre-config path is the directory where pcre-config is contianed.
	example: pcre /usr/local/bin
